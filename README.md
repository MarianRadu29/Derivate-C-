# Derivate C++ 
    This is a program that derives almost any mathematical expression, provided that the expression is written correctly.
    The functions used are arithmetic(+,-,*,/,^), logb(b is the base of the logarithm), ln, sin, cos,tg,ctg,arcsin,arccos,arctg,arcctg and 'x' is the parameter of the function.
    The functions in the program have Romanian names.
    What is different from the English language are the functions tg(tan), ctg(cot), arctg(arctan), arcctg(arccot).
    Exponentiation or radicals with a positive and negative base are rational fractions. For example sqrt(x) -> x^(1/2) or 1/(x^2) ->x^(-2) etc.
    This project was done in the first semester of the first year of college at the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University in Iasi at the Faculty of Computer Science.

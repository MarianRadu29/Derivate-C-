# Derivate C++ 
    This is a program that derives almost any mathematical expression, provided that the expression is written correctly.
    The functions used are arithmetic(+,-,*,/,^), logb(b is the base of the logarithm), ln, sin, cos,tg,ctg,arcsin,arccos,arctg,arcctg and 'x' is the parameter of the function.
    The functions in the program have Romanian names.
    What is different from the English language are the functions tg(tan), ctg(cot), arctg(arctan), arcctg(arccot).
    Exponentiation or radicals with a positive and negative base are rational fractions. For example sqrt(x) -> x^(1/2) or 1/(x^2) ->x^(-2) etc.
